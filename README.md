## Flutter Packages Used

This apps amazingly built with multiple of packages. Main architecture of the apps are using the latest Bloc State Management v8.0.1. This was my first time ever using this kind of architecture because usually I used GetX State Management. This apps also implemented Dio for http request and Dio Cache Interceptor for cache all the APIs. Whenever the network are offline, this apps can still used as the APIs are stored in cache at the first run.
